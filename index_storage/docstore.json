We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and\nforward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The ar-\nchitecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable\nwithout modi\ufb01cation to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test\nthe proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and\nTOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two con\ufb01gurations of N-BEATS for\nall the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11% over a statistical benchmark\nand by 3% over last year\u2019s winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted\nhand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models.\nThe \ufb01rst con\ufb01guration of our model does not employ any time-series-speci\ufb01c\ncomponents and its performance on heterogeneous datasets strongly suggests that,\ncontrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are\nby themselves suf\ufb01cient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs\nthat are interpretable without considerable loss in accuracy.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nTime series (TS) forecasting is an important business problem and a fruitful application area for\nmachine learning (ML). It underlies most aspects of modern business, including such critical areas as\ninventory control and customer management, as well as business planning going from production and\ndistribution to \ufb01nance and marketing. As such, it has a considerable \ufb01nancial impact, often ranging\nin the millions of dollars for every point of forecasting accuracy gained (Jain, 2017; Kahn, 2003).\nAnd yet, unlike areas such as computer vision or natural language processing where deep learning\n(DL) techniques are now well entrenched, there still exists evidence that ML and DL struggle to\noutperform classical statistical TS forecasting approaches (Makridakis et al., 2018a;b). For instance,\nthe rankings of the six \u201cpure\u201d ML methods submitted to M4 competition were 23, 37, 38, 48, 54,\nand 57 out of a total of 60 entries, and most of the best-ranking methods were ensembles of classical\nstatistical techniques (Makridakis et al., 2018b).\nOn the other hand, the M4 competition winner (Smyl, 2020), was based on a hybrid between\nneural residual/attention dilated LSTM stack with a classical Holt-Winters statistical model (Holt,\n1957; 2004; Winters, 1960) with learnable parameters. Since Smyl\u2019s approach heavily depends on\nthis Holt-Winters component, Makridakis et al. (2018b) further argue that \u201chybrid approaches and\ncombinations of method are the way forward for improving the forecasting accuracy and making\nforecasting more valuable\u201d. In this work we aspire to challenge this conclusion by exploring the\npotential of pure DL architectures in the context of the TS forecasting. Moreover, in the context of\ninterpretable DL architecture design, we are interested in answering the following question: can we\n1arXiv:1905.10437v4  [cs.LG]  20 Feb 2020", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3541, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fadfcf5b-6f76-4047-92a0-f84157f512d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fadfcf5b-6f76-4047-92a0-f84157f512d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "n_beats.pdf", "file_path": "data/n_beats.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1119473, "creation_date": "2024-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16", "section_summary": "### Summary:\n\n**Key Topics:**\n1. **Deep Neural Architecture for Time Series Forecasting:**\n   - The paper presents a deep learning (DL) architecture that outperforms traditional statistical methods on M3, M4, and TOURISM datasets.\n   - It claims significant improvements over statistical benchmarks and competition winners, providing a proof of concept for using pure machine learning (ML) in time series (TS) forecasting.\n\n2. **Interpretable Deep Learning:**\n   - The architecture is designed to produce interpretable outputs, similar to traditional decomposition techniques like the \"seasonality-trend-level\" approach.\n\n3. **Problem Statement:**\n   - The focus is on univariate point forecasting in discrete time.\n   - The task involves predicting future values based on observed series history.\n   - Common metrics for evaluating forecasting performance include sMAPE, MAPE, MASE, and OWA.\n\n4. **N-BEATS Architecture:**\n   - The architecture is designed to be simple, generic, and expressive without relying on time-series-specific feature engineering or input scaling.\n   - It aims to be extendable for human interpretability.\n   - The basic building block of the architecture has a fork design, focusing on the operation of each block in detail.\n\n**Key Entities:**\n1. **Datasets:**\n   - M3, M4, TOURISM\n\n2. **Metrics:**\n   - sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)\n   - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)\n   - MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)\n   - OWA (Overall Weighted Average)\n\n3. **Authors and References:**\n   - Hyndman & Koehler (2006)\n   - Makridakis & Hibon (2000)\n   - Makridakis et al.

In our view, this\nprovides a long-missing proof of concept for the use of pure ML in TS forecasting and strengthens\nmotivation to continue advancing the research in this area.\nInterpretable DL for Time Series: In addition to accuracy bene\ufb01ts, we also show that it is fea-\nsible to design an architecture with interpretable outputs that can be used by practitioners in very\nmuch the same way as traditional decomposition techniques such as the \u201cseasonality-trend-level\u201d\napproach (Cleveland et al., 1990).\n2 P ROBLEM STATEMENT\nWe consider the univariate point forecasting problem in discrete time. Given a length- Hforecast\nhorizon a length- Tobserved series history [y1,..., yT]\u2208RT, the task is to predict the vector of\nfuture values y\u2208RH= [yT+1,yT+2,..., yT+H]. For simplicity, we will later consider a lookback\nwindow of length t\u2264Tending with the last observed value yTto serve as model input, and denoted\nx\u2208Rt= [yT\u2212t+1,..., yT]. We denote\u02c6ythe forecast of y. The following metrics are commonly\nused to evaluate forecasting performance (Hyndman & Koehler, 2006; Makridakis & Hibon, 2000;\nMakridakis et al., 2018b; Athanasopoulos et al., 2011):\nsMAPE =200\nHH\n\u2211\ni=1|yT+i\u2212\u02c6yT+i|\n|yT+i|+|\u02c6yT+i|, MAPE =100\nHH\n\u2211\ni=1|yT+i\u2212\u02c6yT+i|\n|yT+i|,\nMASE =1\nHH\n\u2211\ni=1|yT+i\u2212\u02c6yT+i|\n1\nT+H\u2212m\u2211T+H\nj=m+1|yj\u2212yj\u2212m|, OWA=1\n2[sMAPE\nsMAPE Na\u00efve2+MASE\nMASE Na\u00efve2]\n.\nHere mis the periodicity of the data ( e.g., 12 for monthly series). MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage\nError), sMAPE (symmetric MAPE ) and MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error) are standard scale-free\nmetrics in the practice of forecasting (Hyndman & Koehler, 2006; Makridakis & Hibon, 2000):\nwhereas sMAPE scales the error by the average between the forecast and ground truth, the MASE\nscales by the average error of the na\u00efve predictor that simply copies the observation measured m\nperiods in the past, thereby accounting for seasonality. OWA (overall weighted average) is a M4-\nspeci\ufb01c metric used to rank competition entries (M4 Team, 2018b), where sMAPE and MASE metrics\nare normalized such that a seasonally-adjusted na\u00efve forecast obtains OWA=1.0.\n3 N-BEATS\nOur architecture design methodology relies on a few key principles. First, the base architecture\nshould be simple and generic, yet expressive (deep). Second, the architecture should not rely on time-\nseries-speci\ufb01c feature engineering or input scaling. These prerequisites let us explore the potential\nof pure DL architecture in TS forecasting. Finally, as a prerequisite to explore interpretability, the\narchitecture should be extendable towards making its outputs human interpretable. We now discuss\nhow those principles converge to the proposed architecture.\n3.1 B ASIC BLOCK\nThe proposed basic building block has a fork architecture and is depicted in Fig. 1 (left).

The DenseNet architecture proposed by Huang\net al. (2017) extends this principle by introducing extra connections from the output of each stack to\nthe input of every other stack that follows it. These approaches provide clear advantages in improving\nthe trainability of deep architectures. Their disadvantage in the context of this work is that they result\nin network structures that are dif\ufb01cult to interpret. We propose a novel hierarchical doubly residual\ntopology depicted in Fig. 1 (middle and right). The proposed architecture has two residual branches,\none running over backcast prediction of each layer and the other one is running over the forecast\nbranch of each layer. Its operation is described by the following equations:\nx\u2113=x\u2113\u22121\u2212\u02c6x\u2113\u22121,\u02c6y=\u2211\n\u2113\u02c6y\u2113.\nAs previously mentioned, in the special case of the very \ufb01rst block, its input is the model level\ninput x,x1\u2261x. For all other blocks, the backcast residual branch x\u2113can be thought of as running a\nsequential analysis of the input signal. Previous block removes the portion of the signal \u02c6x\u2113\u22121that\nit can approximate well, making the forecast job of the downstream blocks easier. This structure\nalso facilitates more \ufb02uid gradient backpropagation. More importantly, each block outputs a partial\nforecast\u02c6y\u2113that is \ufb01rst aggregated at the stack level and then at the overall network level, providing a\nhierarchical decomposition. The \ufb01nal forecast \u02c6yis the sum of all partial forecasts. In a generic model\ncontext, when stacks are allowed to have arbitrary gb\n\u2113andgf\n\u2113for each layer, this makes the network\nmore transparent to gradient \ufb02ows. In a special situation of deliberate structure enforced in gb\n\u2113andgf\n\u2113shared over a stack, explained next, this has the critical importance of enabling interpretability via the\naggregation of meaningful partial forecasts.\n3.3 I NTERPRETABILITY\nWe propose two con\ufb01gurations of the architecture, based on the selection of gb\n\u2113andgf\n\u2113. One of them\nis generic DL, the other one is augmented with certain inductive biases to be interpretable.\nThegeneric architecture does not rely on TS-speci\ufb01c knowledge. We set gb\n\u2113andgf\n\u2113to be a linear\nprojection of the previous layer output. In this case the outputs of block \u2113are described as:\n\u02c6y\u2113=Vf\n\u2113\u03b8f\n\u2113+bf\n\u2113,\u02c6x\u2113=Vb\n\u2113\u03b8b\n\u2113+bb\n\u2113.\nThe interpretation of this model is that the FC layers in the basic building block depicted in Fig. 1 learn\nthe predictive decomposition of the partial forecast \u02c6y\u2113in the basis Vf\n\u2113learned by the network. Matrix\nVf\n\u2113has dimensionality H\u00d7dim(\u03b8f\n\u2113). Therefore, the \ufb01rst dimension of Vf\n\u2113has the interpretation of\ndiscrete time index in the forecast domain. The second dimension of the matrix has the interpretation\nof the indices of the basis functions, with \u03b8f\n\u2113being the expansion coef\ufb01cients for this basis. Thus the\ncolumns of Vf\n\u2113can be thought of as waveforms in the time domain.

A typical characteristic of trend is that most of the time it is a monotonic function, or\nat least a slowly varying function. In order to mimic this behaviour we propose to constrain gb\ns,\u2113and\ngf\ns,\u2113to be a polynomial of small degree p, a function slowly varying across forecast window:\n\u02c6ys,\u2113=p\n\u2211\ni=0\u03b8f\ns,\u2113,iti.

The statistical model-\ning approaches based on exponential smoothing and its different \ufb02avors are well established and\nare often considered a default choice in the industry (Holt, 1957; 2004; Winters, 1960). More\nadvanced variations of exponential smoothing include the winner of M3 competition, the Theta\nmethod (Assimakopoulos & Nikolopoulos, 2000) that decomposes the forecast into several theta-lines\nand statistically combines them. The pinnacle of the statistical approach encapsulates ARIMA,\nauto-ARIMA and in general, the uni\ufb01ed state-space modeling approach, that can be used to ex-\nplain and analyze all of the approaches mentioned above (see Hyndman & Khandakar (2008) for\nan overview). More recently, ML/TS combination approaches started in\ufb01ltrating the domain with\ngreat success, showing promising results by using the outputs of statistical engines as features. In\nfact, 2 out of top-5 entries in the M4 competition are approaches of this type, including the second\nentry (Montero-Manso et al., 2019). The second entry computes the outputs of several statistical\nmethods on the M4 dataset and combines them using gradient boosted tree (Chen & Guestrin, 2016).\nSomewhat independently, the work in the modern deep learning TS forecasting developed based on\nvariations of recurrent neural networks (Flunkert et al., 2017; Rangapuram et al., 2018b; Toubeau\net al., 2019; Zia & Razzaq, 2018) being largely dominated by the electricity load forecasting in the\nmulti-variate setup. A few earlier works explored the combinations of recurrent neural networks\nwith dilation, residual connections and attention (Chang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Qin et al.,\n2017). These served as a basis for the winner of the M4 competition (Smyl, 2020). The winning\nentry combines a Holt-Winters style seasonality model with its parameters \ufb01tted to a given TS via\ngradient descent and a unique combination of dilation/residual/attention approaches for each forecast\nhorizon. The resulting model is a hybrid model that architecturally heavily relies on a time-series\nengine. It is hand crafted to each speci\ufb01c horizon of M4, making this approach hard to generalize to\nother datasets.\n5 E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur key empirical results based on aggregate performance metrics over several datasets\u2014M4 (M4\nTeam, 2018b; Makridakis et al., 2018b), M3 (Makridakis & Hibon, 2000; Makridakis et al., 2018a)\nand TOURISM (Athanasopoulos et al., 2011)\u2014appear in Table 1.

ProLogistica is the third entry in M4 based on the weighted ensemble of statistical\nmethods. Finally, DL/TS hybrid is the winner of M4 competition (Smyl, 2020). On the M3 dataset ,\nwe compare against the Theta method (Assimakopoulos & Nikolopoulos, 2000), the winner of M3;\nDOTA , a dynamically optimized Theta model (Fiorucci et al., 2016); EXP, the most resent statistical\napproach and the previous state-of-the-art on M3 (Spiliotis et al., 2019); as well as ForecastPro , an\noff-the-shelf forecasting software that is based on model selection between exponential smoothing,\nARIMA and moving average (Athanasopoulos et al., 2011; Assimakopoulos & Nikolopoulos, 2000).\nOn the TOURISM dataset , we compare against 3 statistical benchmarks (Athanasopoulos et al.,\n2011): ETS, exponential smoothing with cross-validated additive/multiplicative model; Theta method;\nForePro , same as ForecastPro in M3; as well as top 2 entries from the TOURISM Kaggle competi-\ntion (Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2011): Stratometrics , an unknown technique; LeeCBaker (Baker\n& Howard, 2011), a weighted combination of Na\u00efve, linear trend model, and exponentially weighted\nleast squares regression trend.\nAccording to Table 1, N-BEATS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nnon-overlapping datasets containing time series from very different domains, sampling frequencies\nand seasonalities. As an example, on M4 dataset, the OWA gap between N-BEATS and the M4\nwinner ( 0.821\u22120.795=0.026) is greater than the gap between the M4 winner and the second entry\n(0.838\u22120.821=0.017). Generic N-BEATS model uses as little prior knowledge as possible, with\nno feature engineering, no scaling and no internal architectural components that may be considered\nTS-speci\ufb01c. Thus the result in Table 1 leads us to the conclusion that DL does not need support\nfrom the statistical approaches or hand-crafted feature engineering and domain knowledge to perform\nextremely well on a wide array of TS forecasting tasks. On top of that, the proposed general\narchitecture performs very well on three different datasets outperforming a wide variety of models,\nboth generic and manually crafted to respective dataset, including the winner of M4, a model\narchitecturally adjusted by hand to each forecast-horizon subset of the M4 data.\n5.1 D ATASETS\nM4(M4 Team, 2018b; Makridakis et al., 2018b) is the latest in an in\ufb02uential series of forecasting\ncompetitions organized by Spyros Makridakis since 1982 (Makridakis et al., 1982).

N-BEATS is implemented and trained in Tensor\ufb02ow (Abadi et al., 2015). We\nshare parameters of the network across horizons, therefore we train one model per horizon for each\ndataset. If every time series is interpreted as a separate task, this can be linked back to the multitask\nlearning and furthermore to meta-learning (see discussion in Section 6), in which a neural network\nis regularized by learning on multiple tasks to improve generalization. We would like to stress that\nmodels for different horizons and datasets reuse the same architecture. Architectural hyperparameters\n(width, number of layers, number of stacks, etc.) are \ufb01xed to the same values across horizons and\nacross datasets (see Appendix D). The fact that we can reuse architecture and even hyperparameters\nacross horizons indicates that the proposed architecture design generalizes well across time series of\ndifferent nature. The same architecture is successfully trained on the M4 Monthly subset with 48k\ntime series and the M3 Others subset with 174 time series. This is a much stronger result than e.g.the\nresult of S. Smyl (Makridakis et al., 2018b) who had to use very different architectures hand crafted\nfor different horizons.\nTo update network parameters for one horizon, we sample train batches of \ufb01xed size 1024. We pick\n1024 TS ids from this horizon, uniformly at random with replacement. For each selected TS id we\npick a random forecast point from the historical range of length LHimmediately preceding the last\npoint in the train part of the TS. LHis a cross-validated hyperparameter. We observed that for subsets\nwith large number of time series it tends to be smaller and for subsets with smaller number of time\nseries it tends to be larger. For example, in massive Yearly, Monthly, Quarterly subsets of M4 LHis\nequal to 1.5; and in moderate to small Weekly, Daily, Hourly subsets of M4 LHis equal to 10. Given\na sampled forecast point, we set one horizon worth of points following it to be the target forecast\nwindow yand we set the history of points of one of lengths 2H,3H,..., 7Hpreceding it to be the\ninput xto the network. We use the Adam optimizer with default settings and initial learning rate\n0.001. While optimising the ensemble members relying on the minimization of sMAPE metric, we\nstop the gradient \ufb02ows in the denominator to make training numerically stable. The neural network\ntraining is run with early stopping and the number of batches is determined on the validation set. The\nGPU based training of one ensemble member for entire M4 dataset takes between 30 min and 2 hours\ndepending on neural network settings and hardware.\n5.3 I NTERPRETABILITY RESULTS\nFig. 2 studies the outputs of the proposed model in the generic and the interpretable con\ufb01gurations.\nAs discussed in Section 3.3, to make the generic architecture presented in Fig. 1 interpretable, we\nconstrain g\u03b8in the \ufb01rst stack to have the form of polynomial (2)while the second one has the form\nof Fourier basis (3). Furthermore, we use the outputs of the generic con\ufb01guration of N-BEATS as\ncontrol group (the generic model of 30 residual blocks depicted in Fig. 1 is divided into two stacks)\nand we plot both generic (suf\ufb01x \u201c-G\u201d) and interpretable (suf\ufb01x \u201c-I\u201d) stack outputs side by side in\nFig. 2. The outputs of generic model are arbitrary and non-interpretable: either trend or seasonality\nor both of them are present at the output of both stacks. The magnitude of the output (peak-to-peak)\nis generally smaller at the output of the second stack. The outputs of the interpretable model exhibit\ndistinct properties: the trend output is monotonic and slowly moving, the seasonality output is\nregular, cyclical and has recurring \ufb02uctuations. The peak-to-peak magnitude of the seasonality output\nis signi\ufb01cantly larger than that of the trend, if signi\ufb01cant seasonality is present in the time series.\nSimilarly, the peak-to-peak magnitude of trend output tends to be small when no obvious trend\nis present in the ground truth signal. Thus the proposed interpretable architecture decomposes its\nforecast into two distinct components. Our conclusion is that the outputs of the DL model can be\nmade interpretable by encoding a sensible inductive bias in the architecture.

The inner learning procedure takes a single history from a piece of a\nTS and sees that history as a training set. It produces forward expansion coef\ufb01cients \u03b8f(see Fig. 1),\nwhich parametrically map inputs to predictions.

Key points include:\n\n1. **Architecture and Performance**:\n   - The proposed architecture is general, flexible, and performs well across various TS forecasting problems.\n   - It was tested on three challenging competition datasets: M4, M3, and TOURISM, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both generic and interpretable configurations.\n\n2. **Hypotheses Validated**:\n   - The generic deep learning (DL) approach is highly effective for heterogeneous univariate TS forecasting without requiring domain-specific knowledge.\n   - It is feasible to constrain a DL model to produce human-interpretable outputs by decomposing its forecasts.\n\n3. **Multi-task Learning**:\n   - The study demonstrated that DL models could be trained on multiple time series in a multi-task fashion, allowing for successful transfer and sharing of individual learnings.\n\n4. **Speculation on Meta-Learning**:\n   - The authors speculate that part of N-BEATS's performance may be due to a form of meta-learning, suggesting this as a topic for future research.\n\n5. **References**:\n   - The section includes a list of references, citing works related to machine learning, forecasting methods, and specific models and techniques such as TensorFlow, the theta model, bagging predictors, and XGBoost.\n\n### Key Entities:\n- **N-BEATS**: The novel architecture for univariate TS forecasting.\n- **Datasets**: M4, M3, TOURISM.\n- **Deep Learning (DL)**: The approach used for forecasting.\n- **Meta-Learning**: A potential factor in N-BEATS's performance.\n- **References**: Various authors and works cited, including TensorFlow, the theta model, and XGBoost.\n\n### Key Topics:\n- Univariate time series forecasting\n- Deep learning architectures\n- Multi-task learning\n- Meta-learning\n- Human-interpretable model outputs\n- Performance validation on competition datasets"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data/n_beats.pdf_part_9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "n_beats.pdf", "file_path": "data/n_beats.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1119473, "creation_date": "2024-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "344df095251b28dc929622b6bfa49b2bd3d763199c3ce02daf8c589846e5f551", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020\n7 C ONCLUSIONS\nWe proposed and empirically validated a novel architecture for univariate TS forecasting. We showed\nthat the architecture is general, \ufb02exible and it performs well on a wide array of TS forecasting prob-\nlems. We applied it to three non-overlapping challenging competition datasets: M4, M3 and TOURISM\nand demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in two con\ufb01gurations: generic and interpretable. This\nallowed us to validate two important hypotheses: (i) the generic DL approach performs exceptionally\nwell on heterogeneous univariate TS forecasting problems using no TS domain knowledge, (ii) it is\nviable to additionally constrain a DL model to force it to decompose its forecast into distinct human\ninterpretable outputs. We also demonstrated that the DL models can be trained on multiple time series\nin a multi-task fashion, successfully transferring and sharing individual learnings. We speculate that\nN-BEATS\u2019s performance can be attributed in part to it carrying out a form of meta-learning, a deeper\ninvestigation of which should be the subject of future work.\nREFERENCES\nMart\u00edn Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, Craig Citro, Greg S.\nCorrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghemawat, Ian Goodfellow, Andrew\nHarp, Geoffrey Irving, Michael Isard, Yangqing Jia, Rafal Jozefowicz, Lukasz Kaiser, Manjunath\nKudlur, Josh Levenberg, Dan Man\u00e9, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek Murray, Chris Olah, Mike\nSchuster, Jonathon Shlens, Benoit Steiner, Ilya Sutskever, Kunal Talwar, Paul Tucker, Vincent\nVanhoucke, Vijay Vasudevan, Fernanda Vi\u00e9gas, Oriol Vinyals, Pete Warden, Martin Wattenberg,\nMartin Wicke, Yuan Yu, and Xiaoqiang Zheng.

The key topics and entities covered include:\n\n1. **Layer Stacking and Basis Synergy**:\n   - **Layer Stacking**: The study investigates the impact of increasing the number of stacks in the generic architecture, each consisting of one residual block with 5 fully connected (FC) layers. Results in Table 5 show that increasing the number of stacks reduces the error, with diminishing returns after a certain point.\n   - **Basis Synergy**: The interpretable architecture, which combines trend and seasonality models in different stacks, shows improved performance when layers are stacked. Table 6 indicates that architectures with different basis functions (trend and seasonality) perform better than those with a single type of layer.\n\n2. **Ensemble Size**:\n   - Figure 3 demonstrates that increasing the ensemble size enhances performance. N-BEATS achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relatively small ensemble size of 18 models, indicating computational efficiency.\n\n3. **Doubly Residual Stacking (DRESS)**:\n   - The section describes the DRESS principle, which involves running a residual backcast connection and producing partial block-level forecasts aggregated at stack and model levels. The study compares the accuracy of this topology against alternatives by removing either the backcast or partial forecast links or both, while keeping the number of parameters constant.\n\n### Key Entities:\n- **sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: The performance metric used for evaluation.\n- **N-BEATS**: The model being evaluated.\n- **Generic Architecture**: Consists of stacks with residual blocks.\n- **Interpretable Architecture**: Combines trend and seasonality models in different stacks.\n- **DRESS (Doubly Residual Stacking)**: A topological principle used in N-BEATS.\n- **Residual Block**: A component of the network architecture.\n- **Fully Connected (FC) Layers**: Layers used within residual blocks.\n- **Ensemble Size**: The number of models used in the ensemble.\n\nThe section provides detailed insights into how different architectural choices and configurations affect the performance of the N-BEATS model."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "data/n_beats.pdf_part_14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "n_beats.pdf", "file_path": "data/n_beats.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1119473, "creation_date": "2024-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b78d1f58ace8098c74464e5312dabd8fa2c707a1fe6aa8e3153ae913f7273f45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020\nTable 5: sMAPE on the validation set, generic ar-\nchitecture. sMAPE for varying number of stacks,\neach having one residual block.\nStacks s MAPE\n1 11.154\n3 11.061\n9 10.998\n18 10.950\n30 10.937Table 6: sMAPE on the validation set, inter-\npretable architecture.

First, Is stacking layers helpful? Second, Does\nthe architecture based on the combination of layers with different basis functions results in better\nperformance than the architecture using only one layer type?\nLayer stacking. We start our study with the generic architecture that consists of stacks of one\nresidual block of 5 FC layers each of the form Fig. 1 and we increase the number of stacks. Results\npresented in Table 5 con\ufb01rm that increasing the number of stacks decreases error and at certain point\nthe gain saturates. We would like to mention that the network having 30 stack of depth 5 is in fact a\nvery deep network of total depth 150 layers.\nBasis synergy. Stacking works well for the interpretable architecture as can be seen in Table 6\ndepicting the results of ablating the interpretable architecture con\ufb01guration. Here we experiment\nwith the architecture that is composed of 2 stacks, stack one is trend model and stack two is the\nseasonality model. Each stack has variable number of residual blocks and each residual block has 5\nFC layers. We found that this architecture works best when all weights are shared within stack. We\nclearly see that increasing the number of layers improves performance. The largest network is 60\nlayers deep. On top of that, we observe that the architecture that consists of stacks based on different\nbasis functions wins over the architecture based on the same stack. It looks like chaining stacks of\ndifferent nature results in synergistic effects. This is logical as function classes that can be modelled\nby trend and seasonality stacks have small overlap.\nB.2 E NSEMBLE SIZE\nFigure 3 demonstrates that increasing the ensemble size results in improved performance. Most\nimportantly, according to Figure 3, N-BEATS achieves state-of-the-art performance even if compara-\ntively small ensemble size of 18 models is used. Therefore, computational ef\ufb01ciency of N-BEATS\ncan be traded very effectively for performance and there is no over-reliance of the results on large\nensemble size.\nB.3 D OUBLY RESIDUAL STACKING\nIn Section 3.2 we described the proposed doubly residual stacking (DRESS) principle, which is the\ntopological foundation of N-BEATS. The topology is based on both (i) running a residual backcast\nconnection and (ii) producing partial block-level forecasts that are further aggregated at stack and\nmodel levels to produce the \ufb01nal model-level forecast. In this section we conduct a study to con\ufb01rm\nthe accuracy effectiveness of this topology compared to several alternatives. The methodology\nunderlying this study is that we remove either the backcast or partial forecast links or both and track\nhow this affects the forecasting metrics. We keep the number of parameters in the network for each\nof the architectural alternatives \ufb01xed by using the same number of layers in the network (we used\ndefault hyperparameter settings reported in Table 18). The architectural alternatives are depicted in\nFigure 4 and described in detail below.\n15", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3674, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "060b0d4a-e702-46ef-acd2-156dfe499c02": {"__data__": {"id_": "060b0d4a-e702-46ef-acd2-156dfe499c02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "n_beats.pdf", "file_path": "data/n_beats.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1119473, "creation_date": "2024-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16", "section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe section discusses the performance and architectural variations of the N-BEATS model, particularly focusing on its application to the M4 dataset.

This is the default con\ufb01guration of N-BEATS using doubly\nresidual stacking described in Section 3.2.\nPARALLEL is depicted in Fig. 4b. This is the alternative where the backward residual connection is\ndisabled and the overall model input is fed to every block. The blocks then forecast in parallel using\nthe same input and their individual outputs are summed to make the \ufb01nal forecast.\nNO-RESIDUAL is depicted in Fig. 4c. This is the alternative where the backward residual connection\nis disabled. Unlike PARALLEL, in this case the backcast forecast of the previous block is fed as input\nto the next block. Unlike the usual feed-forward network, in the NO-RESIDUAL architecture, each\nblock makes a partial forecast and their individual outputs are summed to make the \ufb01nal forecast.\nLAST-FORWARD is depicted in Fig. 4d. This is the alternative where the backward residual\nconnection is active, however the model level forecast is derived only from the last block. So, the\npartial forward forecasts are disabled. This is the architecture that is closest to the classical residual\nnetwork.\nNO-RESIDUAL-LAST-FORWARD is depicted in Fig. 4f. This is the alternative where both\nbackward residual and the partial forward connections are disabled. This is therefore a simple\nfeed-forward network, but very deep.\nThe quantitative ablation study results on the M4 dataset are reported in Tables 7\u201310. N-BEATS-\nDRESS model is essentially N-BEATS model in this study. For this study we used ensemble size\nof 18. Since the ensemble size is 18 for N-BEATS-DRESS, as opposed to 180 used for N-BEATS,\nthe OWA metric reported in Table 9 for N-BEATS-DRESS is higher than the OWA reported for\nN-BEATS-G in Table 12. Note that both results align well with OWA reported in Figure 3 for different\nensemble sizes, as part of the ensemble size ablation conducted in Section B.2.\nThe results presented in Tables 7\u201310 demonstrate that the doubly residual stacking topology provides\na clear overall advantage over the alternative architectures in which either backcast residual links or\nthe partial forward forecast links are disabled.\n16", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2469, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e2547cd-23ed-437f-a0f1-8142593e7eb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e2547cd-23ed-437f-a0f1-8142593e7eb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "n_beats.pdf", "file_path": "data/n_beats.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1119473, "creation_date": "2024-08-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16", "section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe section from page 17 of the document \"n_beats.pdf\" primarily discusses the architectural configurations and performance evaluations of different models used in the N-BEATS framework for time series forecasting.

According to the authors, the underlying RNN had problems dealing with\nraw seasonal data, the ETS based pre-processing was not effective and the LGT pre-processing was\nnot computationally feasible given comparatively large number of time series and their comparatively\nlarge length (Smyl & Kuber, 2016). Finally, EXP (Spiliotis et al., 2019) reported average performance\ncomputed using a different methodology than the default M3 and M4 methodology (source: personal\ncommunication with the authors). For the latter method we recomputed the Average sMAPE based on\nthe previously reported Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly splits. To calculate it, we follow the M3, M4\nand TOURISM competition methodology and compute the average metric as the average over all time\nseries and over all forecast horizons. Given the performance metric values aggregated over Yearly,\nQuarterly and Monthly splits, the average can be computed straightforwardly as:\nsMAPE Average =NYear\nNTotsMAPE Year+NQuart\nNTotsMAPE Quart+NMonth\nNTotsMAPE Month+NOthers\nNTotsMAPE Others.\n(5)\nHere NTot=NYear+NQuart+NMonth+NOthers andNYear=6\u00d7645,NQuart=8\u00d7756,NMonth =18\u00d7\n1428,NOthers =8\u00d7174.

Some of the participants chose to\ntake part only in the second part. Therefore, In addition to entries present in Table 1, we report\ncompetitors from (Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2011) that have missing results in Yearly compe-\ntition. In particular, SaliMali team is the winner of the Quarterly/Monthly time series forecasting\ncompetition (Brierley, 2011). Their approach is based on a weighted ensemble of statistical methods.\nTeams Robert andIdalgo used unknown approaches. We can see from Table 15 that N-BEATS\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on all subsets of TOURISM dataset. On average, it is state of the\nart and it gains 4.2% over the best-known approach LeeCBaker , and 11.5% over auto-ARIMA.\nThe average metrics have not been reported in the original competition results (Athanasopoulos et al.,\n2011; Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2011). Therefore, in Table 15, we present the Average MAPE\nmetric calculated by us based on the previously reported Yearly, Quarterly and Monthly splits. To\ncalculate it, we follow the M4 competition methodology and compute the average metric as the\naverage over all time series and over all forecast horizons.

The results are presented in in Table 16.\nBoth datasets are aggregated to hourly data, but using different aggregation operations: sum for\nELECTRICITY and mean for TRAFFIC . The hourly aggregation is done so that all the points available\nin(h\u22121 : 00,h: 00]hours are aggregated to hour h, thus if original dataset starts on 2011-01-01\n00:15 then the \ufb01rst time point after aggregation will be 2011-01-01 01:00. For the ELECTRICITY\ndataset we removed the \ufb01rst year from training set, to match the training set used in (Yu et al., 2016),\nbased on the aggregated dataset downloaded from, presumable authors\u2019, github repository4. We also\nmade sure that data points for both ELECTRICITY and TRAFFIC datasets after aggregation match\nthose used in (Yu et al., 2016). The authors of MatFact model were using the last 7 days of datasets\nas test set, but papers from Amazon are using different splits, where the split points are provided by a\ndate. Changing split points without a well grounded reason adds uncertainties to the comparability of\nthe models performances and creates challenges to the reproducibility of the results, thus we were\ntrying to match all different splits in our experiments. It was especially challenging on TRAFFIC\ndataset, where we had to use some heuristics to \ufb01nd records dates; the dataset authors state: \u201c The\nmeasurements cover the period from Jan. 1st 2008 to Mar. 30th 2009\u201d and \u201c We remove public\nholidays from the dataset, as well as two days with anomalies (March 8th 2009 and March 9th 2008)\nwhere all sensors were muted between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. \u201d , but we failed to match a part of the\nprovided labels of week days to actual dates. Therefore, we had to assume that the actual list of gaps,\nwhich include holidays and anomalous days, is the following:\n1. Jan. 1, 2008 (New Year\u2019s Day)\n2. Jan. 21, 2008 (Martin Luther King Jr. Day)\n3. Feb. 18, 2008 (Washington\u2019s Birthday)\n4. Mar. 9, 2008 (Anomaly day)\n5. May 26, 2008 (Memorial Day)\n6. Jul. 4, 2008 (Independence Day)\n7.
